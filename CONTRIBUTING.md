üëãüèº First of all, thanks for being here! You're great üéâ

This resource has been neglected for far too long. I'm hoping to change that - but any additional help is _always_ appreciated. 

## Adding resources

The best way to get involved is to add resources to the various pages in the learning flow. These can be links to server libraries in various languages, embedded videos describing concepts, the latest hangout of the GraphQL community - or anything else really! 

**Every page of the flow is located in the [`docs`](./docs) directory.** Feel free to explore these files to see where your resource fits best or where needs the most support. 

If you're not sure of where your resource should go or have any questions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/carolstran/so-you-want-to-learn-graphql/issues/new) and we can discuss it. 

## Changing the flow

If you have an idea for how to improve the learning flow, please [open an issue](https://github.com/carolstran/so-you-want-to-learn-graphql/issues/new) with a short description of what you're thinking.

## Show your support

If you found this site useful, please consider buying me a coffee so that I can continue to make educational materials!
