# So you want to try GraphQL out?

Now that you have an overview of some GraphQL fundamentals, let's try it out!

We'll be using <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql" target="_blank">GraphiQL</a>, an interactive, in-browser GraphQL IDE. If it sounds familiar, that's because we mentioned it at the very beginning of your journey.

<!-- Explain more about how GraphQL APIs are connected to GraphiQL -->

Here are some APIs that are already connected to a GraphiQL interface. Jump in and start writing queries!

_Helpful GraphiQL hints:_

- Opening up the `Docs` tab in the upper-right corner will show you the reference docs for the API connected to the GraphiQL interface
- If you're on a Mac and click `ctrl + space`, it will tell you your options when writing your query
- You can't use single quotes
